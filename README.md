# Project Summary
The primary goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that automates the routing of credit card transactions to the most appropriate Payment Service Provider (PSP). This predictive model aims to improve transaction success rates and minimize transaction fees, ultimately enhancing both operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.

Current Problem
The existing system for routing transactions is manual and rule-based, leading to inefficiencies such as high failure rates and increased costs due to multiple payment attempts. Customers often retry failed transactions, resulting in unnecessary fees and a poor user experience.

Objective
The objective of this project is to leverage machine learning models to predict the best PSP for each transaction. The model will analyze various features, such as the transaction amount, country, 3D-secured status, and historical PSP performance, to determine the PSP with the highest probability of successfully processing the transaction at the lowest possible cost.

Key Tasks
Data Exploration and Preparation:

Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and relationships that influence transaction outcomes.
Prepare and clean the dataset by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and detecting outliers.
Engineer new features, such as retry identification and PSP success rates, to improve the model's predictive power.
Model Selection and Tuning:

Use Logistic Regression as a baseline model for binary classification.
Implement a more complex model, Random Forest, to capture non-linear relationships in the data.
Optimize model performance through hyperparameter tuning using Grid Search with cross-validation.
Error Analysis and Evaluation:

Analyze the model's misclassifications (false positives and false negatives) to identify areas for improvement.
Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, while considering business costs associated with PSP fees and transaction retries.
Deployment and Integration:

Propose a deployment strategy that integrates the predictive model into the existing transaction system via API.
Create a user-friendly dashboard for business users to monitor transaction outcomes and model performance.
Expected Outcome
The project is expected to deliver a data-driven solution that automates PSP selection, reducing transaction failures and associated costs. By transitioning to this intelligent system, the business can improve transaction success rates, minimize fees, and enhance the overall customer experience.
